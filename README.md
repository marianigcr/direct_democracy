# Direct Democracy and Government Size: Replication Project

In the research paper “Direct democracy and government size, evidence from Spain.” Carlos Sanz examines the effect of direct democracy as a government system on the overall expenditures, revenues, and deficits in Spanish municipalities. He uses a regression discontinuity design and explores alternative mechanisms (reverse causality, confounded treatment by federal transfers, elite capture) and usual robustness checks for his estimations (covariate balance, donut regressions, and placebo tests at other population thresholds). For the analysis, he uses a dataset from 73.6% budgets of Spanish municipalities for the period 1978-2011.

As alternative robustness checks, I replicate the proposed models using a different bandwidth (BW) selector. I find that the research design is sensitive to the BW method used. As an alternative causal mechanism, I discuss the possibility of time-varying factors that might generate bias in the estimations and use a difference in differences design considering a lagged variable for the treatment (direct democracy). I find that by including in the analysis more observations than those included in the bandwidths, the effect of direct democracy becomes positive, and its magnitude is smaller in absolute terms.
